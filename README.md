# Spotify-Analyzation

This project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the popularity of music tracks on streaming platforms, with a particular focus on Spotify. By examining a dataset of the top Spotify songs from 2023, the analysis seeks to identify the musical attributes that influence a song's number of streams. Using clustering techniques and various data analysis methods in R, the project provides insights into the characteristics that make a song more likely to be popular. These insights can be valuable for artists, producers, and marketers in the music industry.
